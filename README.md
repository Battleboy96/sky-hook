# Skylanders PS3 Portal Injector (HEN Plugin Skeleton)

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept skeleton plugin** for PS3 consoles running HEN (Homebrew ENabler), intended to **emulate a Skylanders Portal device** by injecting figure data directly into the game without needing a physical Skylanders Portal peripheral.

---

## ⚠️ WARNING - Experimental!

- This code is **not a finished product**. It is a *starting point* for developers familiar with PS3 homebrew development.
- It contains **placeholders** for USB device detection, hooking methods, and gamepad input reading.
- Use at your own risk. Always test **offline** with backups.  
- This plugin does **not** enable online cheating or piracy. It is designed solely for offline figure emulation and research purposes.

---

## Features (Planned / Conceptual)

- Hook USB read/write calls to intercept portal data requests.
- Serve pre-loaded Skylanders figure dumps from disk.
- Emulate figure read/write behavior to save progress.
- Toggle emulation on/off in-game with a configurable button combo.
- Support swapping between multiple figure dumps (future).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of PS3 homebrew development and the HEN environment.
- PS3 SDK or PSL1GHT installed and configured.
- A PS3 console running HEN.
- The Skylanders PS3 game and optionally a real Skylanders Portal for testing.

### Building

This project uses [PSL1GHT](https://github.com/psl1ght/psl1ght) as the recommended SDK.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace placeholders in `src/plugin.c`:
   - `PORTAL_VENDOR_ID` and `PORTAL_PRODUCT_ID` with real USB IDs.
   - Implement hooking functions (`install_usb_hook`, `remove_usb_hook`).
   - Replace pad polling with real pad API calls.
   - Set dump file paths.
3. Build using PSL1GHT tools (e.g., `ppu-lv2-gcc`).
4. Deploy the `.sprx` plugin to your PS3’s `/dev_hdd0/plugins/` directory.
5. Load the plugin with HEN before launching the game.
